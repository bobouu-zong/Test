Abstract:
In financial services, predicting customer conversion across multiple products is essential for optimizing marketing strategies and resource allocation. Conventional methods rely on building separate ensemble models for each product, which becomes impractical as product portfolios grow. We introduce a novel two-layer model that predicts conversion probabilities for 20 financial products simultaneously. The first layer uses Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) to select and transform features into leaf node embeddings, which are then fed into a deep neural network (DNN) to generate multi-product predictions. This hybrid architecture leverages GBDT’s feature engineering capabilities and DNN’s ability to model complex relationships, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to traditional approaches. We outline the model’s design, experimental framework, and potential benefits, positioning it as a versatile tool for multi-output prediction tasks in finance.

1. Introduction
Financial institutions face the ongoing challenge of predicting customer behavior across diverse product offerings, such as loans, credit cards, and investment accounts. Accurate conversion probability estimates—i.e., the likelihood that a customer will adopt a given product—enable targeted marketing, personalized recommendations, and efficient resource use. Historically, this task has been addressed by developing individual predictive models for each product, often using ensemble techniques like Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) due to their effectiveness on structured data (Chen & Guestrin, 2016). However, as the number of products increases, this approach becomes computationally intensive, difficult to maintain, and blind to potential cross-product relationships.
In this paper, we propose a unified two-layer model to predict conversion probabilities for 20 financial products in a single framework. The first layer employs a GBDT to perform feature selection and transformation, producing leaf node embeddings that encapsulate predictive patterns. These embeddings are then processed by a deep neural network (DNN) to output probabilities across all products. This hybrid design aims to balance scalability, performance, and the ability to capture shared customer behaviors, addressing the limitations of product-specific modeling.
Our work contributes to the growing field of hybrid machine learning by:
Proposing a scalable architecture for multi-product prediction in financial services.
Demonstrating the utility of GBDT leaf embeddings as a bridge to deep learning.
Offering a practical solution that can generalize to other multi-task prediction problems.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 surveys related work, Section 3 describes the methodology, Section 4 details the experimental setup, Section 5 presents results, Section 6 discusses findings and limitations, and Section 7 concludes with future research directions.
2. Related Work
2.1 Predictive Modeling in Finance
Predictive analytics in financial services has evolved from simple statistical models to advanced machine learning techniques. Early methods, such as logistic regression, were used to predict binary outcomes like loan default or product uptake (Hosmer & Lemeshow, 2000). More recently, ensemble methods like Random Forests and GBDT have dominated due to their robustness and ability to handle heterogeneous data (Breiman, 2001; Friedman, 2001). These approaches excel in single-product settings but require replication for each product, leading to inefficiencies in multi-product environments.
2.2 Tree-Based and Neural Network Hybrids
The synergy between tree-based models and neural networks has been explored in various domains. GBDT frameworks like XGBoost (Chen & Guestrin, 2016) and LightGBM (Ke et al., 2017) are widely used for their interpretability and performance on tabular data. Recent studies have proposed integrating these models with neural networks. For instance, Yang et al. (2018) used GBDT outputs as inputs to a DNN for click-through rate prediction, while Ke et al. (2019) introduced a tree-structured neural network for recommendation systems. Our approach extends this paradigm by using GBDT leaf embeddings as a feature transformation layer for multi-output prediction.
2.3 Multi-Output Prediction
Multi-output prediction, often framed as multi-task learning (MTL), seeks to model multiple targets within a single framework (Ruder, 2017). In finance, MTL has been applied to tasks like risk assessment across customer segments (He et al., 2018). Unlike traditional MTL, which typically shares all layers across tasks, our model uses a GBDT layer to preprocess features before task-specific DNN processing, offering a hybrid of shared and specialized learning.
3. Methodology
3.1 Problem Definition
Given a dataset of ( N ) customers, each described by a feature vector 
X_i \in \mathbb{R}^D
 (e.g., age, income, account activity), we aim to predict conversion probabilities 
P(y_{ij} = 1 | X_i)
 for 
J = 20
 products, where 
y_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}
 indicates conversion of customer ( i ) to product ( j ). The input is 
X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D}
, and the target is 
Y \in \{0, 1\}^{N \times J}
, with the model outputting 
\hat{Y} \in [0, 1]^{N \times J}
.
3.2 Proposed Model
Our model comprises two layers: a GBDT layer for feature engineering and a DNN layer for prediction.
3.2.1 GBDT Layer
The GBDT layer transforms raw features into a compact representation. We train a GBDT with ( T ) trees, each of depth ( d ), to minimize a binary classification loss (e.g., log-loss). For each customer ( i ), tree ( t ) assigns 
X_i
 to a leaf node 
l_{it} \in \{1, 2, \ldots, L_t\}
, where 
L_t = 2^d
. The leaf indices across all trees form an embedding 
E_i = [l_{i1}, l_{i2}, \ldots, l_{iT}] \in \mathbb{Z}^T
. We then one-hot encode 
E_i
 into 
E'_i \in \{0, 1\}^{T \times L}
, where 
L = \max_t L_t
, creating a sparse representation of the GBDT’s learned splits.
3.2.2 DNN Layer
The DNN takes 
E'_i
 as input and predicts probabilities for all 20 products. It consists of ( K ) hidden layers with ReLU activations, followed by an output layer with 20 sigmoid-activated nodes. The architecture is:
Input: 
E'_i \in \{0, 1\}^{T \times L}
Hidden layers: 
h_k = \text{ReLU}(W_k h_{k-1} + b_k)
, 
k = 1, \ldots, K
Output: 
\hat{y}_i = \text{sigmoid}(W_{K+1} h_K + b_{K+1})
, 
\hat{y}_i \in [0, 1]^{20}
The loss function is multi-label binary cross-entropy:
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^{20} [y_{ij} \log(\hat{y}_{ij}) + (1 - y_{ij}) \log(1 - \hat{y}_{ij})]
3.3 Training
The GBDT is trained first on the full dataset to generate fixed embeddings. The DNN is then trained on these embeddings using Adam optimization with learning rate 
\eta
, batch size ( B ), and L2 regularization to mitigate overfitting.
4. Experiments
4.1 Dataset
We use a synthetic dataset mimicking financial services data, with 
N = 50,000
 customers, 
D = 40
 features (e.g., demographics, transaction patterns), and 
J = 20
 products. Conversion rates average 4% per product. [Note: Replace with your real dataset.]
4.2 Baselines
We compare our model to:
Individual GBDT: Separate GBDT models per product (
T = 50
, 
d = 5
).
Raw DNN: A DNN trained directly on ( X ) with the same architecture as our DNN layer.
Multi-Task GBDT: A single GBDT with 20 output heads.
4.3 Metrics
We evaluate using per-product AUC, averaged across all products, and report training and inference times for scalability.
4.4 Setup
The GBDT is implemented in XGBoost with 
T = 50
, 
d = 5
, and learning rate 0.05. The DNN, built in TensorFlow, has 
K = 4
 hidden layers ([256, 128, 64, 32]), 
\eta = 0.002
, 
B = 32
, and 100 epochs. Experiments run on a 12-core CPU and an NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU.
5. Results
[Note: Placeholder results—replace with your data.]
The GBDT-DNN model achieves an average AUC of 0.87, surpassing individual GBDT (0.84), raw DNN (0.79), and multi-task GBDT (0.82). Training takes 1.8 hours versus 8 hours for 20 GBDT models, with inference at 0.008 seconds per customer. Product-specific AUCs range from 0.82 to 0.91, indicating robust performance across the portfolio.
6. Discussion
6.1 Insights
The hybrid model effectively leverages GBDT’s feature transformation to enhance DNN performance, capturing both product-specific and shared patterns. Its efficiency makes it viable for large-scale deployment, reducing operational overhead compared to maintaining multiple models.
6.2 Challenges
The static GBDT layer may limit adaptability to new data distributions. Performance dips for products with low conversion rates, suggesting potential improvements via class weighting or oversampling.
6.3 Applications
This model can power real-time recommendation engines, enabling dynamic product prioritization. Its GBDT component also aids feature importance analysis for regulatory transparency.
7. Conclusion
We introduced a two-layer GBDT-DNN model for multi-product conversion prediction, offering a scalable and effective alternative to traditional methods. Future work could explore dynamic GBDT retraining, attention mechanisms, or extension to other industries like e-commerce.
